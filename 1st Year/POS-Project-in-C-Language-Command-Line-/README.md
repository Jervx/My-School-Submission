###### Flaw Of This Application
* The editing Tax, Adding new Products, Editing new Products can be accessed by cashier
* No Sale Statistics

###### Possible Improvements Suggested by the respondents of our project
* The Admin stuff like (editing Tax, Adding new Products, Editing new Products) can only be edited by admin user

###### Notes
